This guide explores three pagination strategies:

1. Simple Pagination: Uses 'page' and 'page_size' to break data into pages, straightforward but sensitive to dataset changes.
2. Hypermedia Pagination: Enhances navigation with metadata, providing links to navigate through pages, ideal for RESTful APIs.
3. Deletion-Resilient Pagination: Employs cursor-based methods to handle dynamic datasets where items might be deleted or added, ensuring stable navigation.

Each method has its use cases, pros, and cons, addressing different needs like ease of implementation, performance with large datasets, and resilience to data changes.
